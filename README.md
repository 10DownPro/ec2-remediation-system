# ‚öôÔ∏è EC2 Remediation System (ServiceNow + AWS)

A scoped ServiceNow app that monitors EC2 instance health, automates incident response, and enables one-click remediation via AWS REST API. Designed to cut down on manual steps, reduce downtime, and streamline DevOps workflows.

---

## üß† Why This Matters

Manual cloud remediation wastes time. This app automates the entire response process‚Äîdetect, alert, remediate‚Äîwhile logging every action for audit & compliance. It's fast, secure, and extendable.

---

## üîß How It Works

**Heartbeat:** AWS Integration Server polls EC2 instance status & pushes data to ServiceNow every 60 seconds.

**When instance is `OFF`:**
1. Flow triggers AI Search for KB recommendations
2. Slack alert sent to DevOps team
3. ServiceNow Incident is auto-created
4. Dev clicks ‚ÄúTrigger EC2 Remediation‚Äù button
5. Script Include sends remediation command to AWS
6. Action is recorded in the Remediation Log table
