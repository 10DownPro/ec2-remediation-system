# ‚öôÔ∏è EC2 Remediation System (ServiceNow + AWS)

A scoped ServiceNow app that detects failed EC2 instances, alerts engineers, and enables one-click remediation via AWS REST API. Built to reduce downtime during large-scale outages and automate manual steps during incident response.

## üé¨ Real-World Scenario: Netflix EC2 Outage

**Problem:**  
Imagine Netflix is experiencing a major EC2 instance failure in its streaming infrastructure‚Äîan edge server in us-west-2 goes dark. Viewers on the West Coast start reporting buffering issues, stream interruptions, and long load times.

In traditional workflows, Netflix‚Äôs DevOps engineers:
- Get pinged in Slack
- Manually dig through logs
- Search internal wikis for solutions
- SSH into the EC2 instance or use the AWS console to restart it

This process takes **10‚Äì15+ minutes**, leading to angry customers, revenue loss, and SLA violations.

## üíº Business Need

Netflix needs a faster, centralized way to:
- Detect failed EC2 instances within seconds  
- Trigger instant Slack notifications  
- Recommend KBs via AI Search inside ServiceNow  
- Open an incident for audit/compliance tracking  
- Let engineers fix the issue in one click  
- Log the action for future review

## üîß How It Works

**Trigger:** AWS Integration Server pushes EC2 status to SNOW every 60 seconds.

**When status = OFF:**
1. Flow Designer initiates AI Search for remediation KBs  
2. Sends Slack alert to DevOps  
3. Creates a ServiceNow Incident  
4. Adds a ‚ÄúTrigger EC2 Remediation‚Äù button to the instance form  
5. Engineer clicks the button ‚Üí REST call sent to AWS  
6. Action is logged in a custom Remediation Log table
